## Overview

So far, this web application provides a tabs page as the main feature, which allows users to generate clean HTML5 code with JS and inline CSS, all with no use of external stylesheets or CSS classes.  

The design of the application was made with simplicity in mind, making it easier to implement client-side code generation from the browser.
